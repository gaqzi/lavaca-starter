Lavaca-starter 2.1.1
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mutualmobile/lavaca.png?branch=amd)](https://travis-ci.org/mutualmobile/lavaca-starter)

Introducing Lavaca-starter, the open source, HTML5 application framework by Mutual Mobile. Jumpstart development of your project by basing them off of Lavaca and using Lavaca's build tools.

Lavaca features:
* A build system supporting multiple configurations for different environments
* An HTML, JavaScript, and CSS packaging and minification system
* A JavaScript documentation generation system
* A unit testing framework
* A JavaScript MVC framework
* A templating framework
* A translation framework
* â€¦as well as many other essential components for modern web applications.

Lavaca has a ton packed into it, and is designed to work well as a cohesive whole, while still remaining lightweight. Lavaca is built with extensibility in mind and allows you to easily extend components and build your own on top of its framework.

## Getting Started

1. __Get the code__
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:mutualmobile/lavaca-starter.git [my_app] && cd [my_app]
```

2. __Install grunt-cli globally__

Note: this may require sudo
```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

3. __Install dev dependencies for our tasks to work__
```bash
$ npm install
```

4. __Start Development Server__
```bash
$ grunt server
```
Your application should now be running on `localhost:8080`.

## Grunt Tasks

Below is a list of grunt tasks to aid development and facilitate deployment.

### Server

A task that simply runs a static server for local development and testing. Defaults to run on `localhost:8080` with `src` being the root directory.

- __Run the default static server__

```bash
$ grunt server
```

### Build

Precompiles LESS and Dust templates, concats and minifies all CSS and JavaScript files, and builds all related files to `www`, `android/assets/www` and `ios/www` directories. 

- __Build with local config__

```bash
$ grunt build
```

- __Build with staging config__ (a copy of the build will be available in `www` folder)

```bash
$ grunt build:staging
```

- __Build with production config__ (a copy of the build will be available in `www` folder)

```bash
$ grunt build:production
```

### Test

Runs unit tests defined in `test/unit` directory with [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) in a headless instance of Webkit using [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).

- __Run unit tests from `test/unit`__

```bash
$ grunt test
```

### Docs

Generates JavaScript documentation using [yuidoc](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-yuidoc). The resulting documentation is outputed to the `doc` folder.

- __Generate JavaScript Documentation__

```bash
$ grunt yuidoc
```
